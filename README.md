# Movies-Budgets-Analysis
In this project, we're going to be looking at movie budget and revenue data. This dataset is perfect for trying out tools like Scikit-learn to run a linear regression and Seaborn, a popular data visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib. 
The question we want to answer is: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more? 



In this project we will discover:

How to use a popular data visualisation library called Seaborn

How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn

How to plot a regression a scatter plot to visualise relationships in the data

How to add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart

How to cleverly use floor division // to convert your data
